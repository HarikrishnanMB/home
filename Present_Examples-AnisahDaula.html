		<h2> Types of Motherboards</h2>
		<p> There are a couple different types of motherboards. They have all different sizes, which are known as "Form Factors". </p>
 
		<ul>
			<li>micro-ATX (µATX) </li>
			<li> Mini-ATX </li>
			<li> FlexATX </li>
			<li> EATX</li>
			<li>WATX</li>
			<li>Nano-ATX</li>
			<li>Pico-ATX</li>
			<li>MobileATX</li>
		</ul>
		<h4> Another smaller form factor is ITX. Which comes from:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>mini-ITX</li>
			<li>nano-ITX</li>
			<li>pico-ITX</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Provided, below is a comparison of the three most <b>mainstream</b> used form factors.

		<h2> Specification of the component and how to choose the right one: </h2>
		<p>There's never a certain universal answer to this. To pick the correct
		motherboard, you have to choose based on the PC that you're planning on
		building or buying. You must choose what works best for the use of the PC based on many factors like, the number of components you want to configure, then you can decide which motherboard best suits your needs. preferences and requirements differ from user to user, so none of the three mainstream motherboard formats can be the best choice for everyone. Below is a chart to consider, which provides common specifications for the three most mainstream form factors. </p>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<th>Type</th>
				<th>Size</th>
				<th>Expansion Slots</th>
				<th>RAM</th>
				<th>RAM Slots</th>
				<th>GPUs</th>         
				<th> SATA ports</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>ATX</td>
				<td>12 x 9.6 inches</td>
				<td>7</td>
				<td>DIMM</td>
				<td>Up to 8 </td>
				<td>Up to 4 </td> 
				<td>Up to 12</td> 
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Micro- ATX</td>
				<td>9.6 x 9.6 inches</td>
				<td>4</td>
				<td>DIMM</td>
				<td>Up to 4</td>

		<h2>Future Trends</h2>
		<p> We'll see more  systems on chip  plans with consolidated CPUs and GPUs. Memory will turn out to be quicker however the form factor will probably remain the equivalent to now with ATX for some time until the gadget needs it to change, for example, to oblige a smaller case. We'll likewise observe increasingly particular reason gadgets that may associate with broadly useful gadgets. We will see more technical devices being integrated to general purpose devices, for example smart tv’s, google homes, Chromecast that uses your phone or computer to stream content to your TV. Asus has also announced a new motherboard concept called,The Asus Prime Utopia, in which they, an many others believe to be the future of mother boards.</p>
