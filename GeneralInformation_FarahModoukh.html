        <h2>Functionalities of Motherboard</h2>
		<hr>
        <p>The Motherboard is known and represented to be as the main board in the computer. It is what holds the components in the computer together and allows communication with each other.
		<br>There are many important components designed in the Motherboard. <br>These components will be listed below. </p>
		<h2>Components in a Motherboard</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>There are many different functions of components included in the Motherboard. Therefore the ones listed will be the most important.</p>

		<h2>Input or Output Device</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>A motherboard is BOTH input and output devices. </p>
		<ul>
			<li> The input devices are known to be the sensors and temperature. </li>
			<li> The output device is the speed of the circuit. </li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Describe what a Motherboard consists of and how it works</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>A motherboard consists of a non-conductive material of being somewhat like a unbendable, stiff plastic sheet. <br>As perviously mentioned, it is what connects the components together for both devices.<br> </p>
